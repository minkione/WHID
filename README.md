## READ FIRST ALL THIS README OR DON'T YOU DARE TO OPEN ISSUES. I AM SERIOUS!<br/>













## HOW TO START [Newbies Edition] ##

Since July 2017 all Cactus WHID are delivered with pre-loaded ESPloitV2 and are ready to Plug-n-Hack âœŒ

Thus, even if you are not an Arduino expert, you can immediately have fun!

Just plug it in an USB port and connect to the WiFi network:

SSID "Exploit" 

Password "DotAgency"

Open a web browser pointed to "http://192.168.1.1"

The default administration username is "admin" and password "hacktheplanet".

## The Hardware ##

## USB Pinouts ##

In order to make easier the process of weaponizing USB gadgets, you can solder the USB wires to the dedicated pinouts.

The pin closer to USB-A is GND. The pins are:

* GND 
* D+ 
* D-  
* VCC

[ In case an USB HUB is needed (i.e. to weaponize some USB gadget or mouse), usually, I do use this one https://www.tindie.com/products/mux/nanohub-tiny-usb-hub-for-hacking-projects or this https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Random-Color-Redbud-High-Speed-USB-2-0-4-Port-HUB-Fashion-Design-HUB-Computer-Accessories/32788390064.html]

## Documentation WIKI ##

I HEAVILY RECOMMEND TO READ IT ALL!
https://github.com/whid-injector/WHID/wiki

## Third-Party Softwares Compatible with WHID's Hardware ##

https://github.com/exploitagency/ESPloitV2  (Improved version of WHID GUI, installed by default on Cactus WHID hardware)

https://github.com/sensepost/USaBUSe (Dedicated software for AirGap bypass Vs Windows)

https://github.com/spacehuhn/wifi_ducky (old software similar to ESPloitV2)


## Possible Applications ##

- Classic: Remote Keystrokes Injection Over WiFi

Deploy WHID on Victim's machine and remotely control it by  accessing its WiFi AP SSID. (eventually you can also setup WHID to connect to an existing WiFi network)

- Social Engineering: Deploy WHID inside an USB gadget

The main idea behind it is to test for Social Engineering weaknesses within your target organization (e.g. DLP policy violations) and to bypass physical access restrictions to Target's device.
Usually, I create a fancy brochure (sample template https://github.com/whid-injector/WHID/tree/master/tools/Social_Engineering_Lures ) attached with a weaponized USB gadget and then use a common delivery carrier (e.g. UPS, DHL, FedEx).
